# üç± Project: Hospitality & Service. Enhancing Restaurant Service Through Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Industry Overview & Business Context
![alt text](image.png)
In the restaurant industry, customer satisfaction is a key driver of success. A single negative review can influence potential diners, while positive feedback builds trust and attracts more customers. With the rise of online reviews, restaurant owners need data-driven insights to understand customer sentiment and improve service accordingly.
A restaurant has collected a dataset of customer reviews to analyze sentiment and identify patterns that can help improve the overall dining experience. By leveraging sentiment analysis, the restaurant aims to gain deeper insights into customer satisfaction, address negative feedback proactively, and enhance service quality.

## Project Scope & Dataset
The dataset contains customer reviews along with a binary sentiment label indicating whether the customer liked or did not like both the food and the overall experience. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sentiment of a given review.

## Dataset Details
The dataset consists of two columns:
Review ‚Äì The actual text of the review written by a customer.
Liked ‚Äì A binary target variable:
1: The customer liked the food.
0: The customer did not like the food.
The dataset can be downloaded from here.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Success in this project will be measured by:
- Model Accuracy: The percentage of correct sentiment predictions.
- Precision & Recall: Ensuring a balanced classification, especially for negative reviews.
- Business Impact: How well the model helps the restaurant identify and address service issues.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Guidelines
To gain deeper insights, consider analyzing:
Review Length & Sentiment: Are longer reviews more likely to be negative or positive?
Frequent Keywords in Positive vs. Negative Reviews: Do certain words signal dissatisfaction (e.g., "cold," "slow," "expensive") while others indicate satisfaction 
(e.g., "delicious," "friendly," "cozy")?
Mixed Sentiments: Are there reviews containing both positive and negative aspects, and how should they be classified?

## Success Factors & Best Practices
To build an effective sentiment analysis model, consider the following:
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing text, removing stopwords, and handling misspellings.
Feature Engineering: Using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, or sentiment lexicons to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Comparing traditional machine learning models like Logistic Regression or Decision Tree
Business Application: Interpreting insights to suggest actionable improvements, such as menu adjustments, staff training, or service optimizations.
By the end of this project, you will build a real-world sentiment analysis model, helping the restaurant turn customer feedback into valuable business strategies.
